# Community in the Skies Modpack
## Description
Community in the Skies is a modpack based on Sky Factory, but that can also be played without a skyblock world.
The "Community" part of the name is because it is a modpack made for people to come together and have fun playing modded Minecraft.

## The Public Server
I (Drak) am currently hosting a public server for the modpack. This server is located at the join address of `skies.plas.host`.

**Note**<br></br>
You will need to keep your modpack up to date to play on the server.

### Server Rules
- No abuse of exploits.
- No raiding or griefing other players' bases.
- No unwanted PVP.
  - This means it is against the rules to kill a player who does not want to be killed.
    - Unless they are at your base (skyblock island) messing around.
- Please claim your base, but do not claim too much.
  - Bases with too big of claims will be shrunk.
- No lag machines...
  - We are on modded, so the lag might be more than on vanilla. Please respect that. Thank you.
- Attempts to crash the server will result in a ban.
- In general, use common sense.

**Note**<br></br>
These are not strictly the only rules, there are some unspoken rules. If we deem it necessary, we will put them on this list.
